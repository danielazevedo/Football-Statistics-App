# Football-Statistics-App

**Football-Statistics-App** is a simple app using the frameworks Sinatra and AngularJs, this app shows the upcoming games of the main European football leagues, as well as their league table. For each game you can look closer at the teams' statistics, for example: number of victories, draws and defeats so far, goals scored and suffered and the time at wich the goals happened. You can also see the results of the previous matches between the two teams.<br />
In order to get the data updated I used football-data API. To use this app you need to have access to an API key.<br />
In the **screenshots** folder you can see some examples.
